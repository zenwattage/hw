Construct the Client class using the array [1, 18, 2, 7, 18, 39, 20] in the main method of
your program to test the LinkedIntList class’s methods.
(You will need to have your ListNode class included as well)

Construct the LinkedIntList class with the following additional methods:
Write a method called size that accepts no argument and returns the current number of
elements in the list.

Write a method called indexOf that accepts an integers as a parameter and returns the
index in the list of the first occurrence of that value, or -1 if the value is not found in the
list. For example, if the list stores [1, 18, 2, 7, 18, 39, 18, 40], then the first index of 18 is 1
and the first index of 3 is -1.

Write another method deleteBack that deletes the last value (the value at the back of the
list) and returns the delete value. If the list is empty, throw a NotSuchElementException .
Write a method called removeAll that removes all occurrences of a particular value. For
example, if the list stores [1, 18, 2, 7, 18, 39, 18, 40], the call of list.removeAll(18); would
change the list to store [1, 2, 7, 39, 40]

Write another method doubleList that doubles the size of a list by appending a copy of
the original sequence to the end of the list. For example, if the list stores [1, 8, 2, 7], your
method should change it to store [1, 8, 2, 7, 1, 8, 2, 7].

Please include the Precondition and Postcondition for each method in the LinkedIntList
class.

Please produce the result as the sample run below.

Sample runs:
list = [1, 18, 2, 7, 18, 39, 20]
list.size() is 7
list.indexOf(2) is 2
list.deleteBack() is 20
After list.deleteBack()
list = [1, 18, 2, 7, 18, 39]
After list.removeAll(18)
list = [1, 2, 7, 39]
After list.doubleList()
list = [1, 2, 7, 39, 1, 2, 7, 39]
